It was developed and maintained by <a href="https://maruan.alshedivat.com">Maruan Al-Shedivat</a>. Starting version <a href="https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio/releases/tag/v0.3.5">v0.3.5</a>, al-folio will automatically re-deploy webpage each time new changes are pushed to the repository. While this feature worked awesomely well in general, we did notice some small issues during our initial deployment of the CLAMS website. As we tried to figure out ways to resolve these issues, we noticed that we were not alone – many people had similar doubts/problems during the deployment of their websites, especially for those who do not have extensive background or experience in computer science, just like us. After we finally understood what was actually going on, we realized that most of the issues were due to the lack of step-by-step documentation for new users. This blog post highlights the key steps needed to successfully deploy your website powered by Jekyll with al-folio theme to GitHub for the first time. Therefore, this post mainly serves to fill the gap in documentation/instructions for new users.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="things-that-may-go-wrong-during-your-first-deployment">Things that may go wrong during your first deployment</h2> <p>After making changes to our code, you would follow the standard <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bundle</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll build</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll serve</code> commands (or simply <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bundle exec jekyll serve</code>) in your terminal to build the site and make it available on a local server. <strong>However, if you are using you are using Ruby version 3.0.0 or higher, this step <a href="https://github.com/github/pages-gem/issues/752">may fail</a> because <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/8523">Ruby 3.0.0 no longer comes with webrick</a>. Therefore, you need to add <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">webrick</code> to your dependencies: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bundle add webrick</code> before proceeding to the next steps.</strong></p> <p>Now, everything looks great on our local host <a href="http://localhost:4000">http://localhost:4000</a>. Since you are aware of the automatic deployment feature added to versions <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">v0.3.5</code> and newer, you think you just need to push the changes to GitHub (most probably to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">master</code> branch), and GitHub should just automatically deploy your website. After all, everything works well locally, what else can happen? OOps! Most likely you will receive an error message like this:</p> <p align="center"><img src="/assets/img/blogpost/2022-10-21-blog1.png" width="750"/></p> <p>In fact, you are not the only one who had this issue (see <a href="https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio/issues/529">here</a>, <a href="https://github.com/inukshuk/jekyll-scholar/issues/194">here</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio/issues/69">here</a> for issues related to ‘bibliography’, and <a href="https://github.com/inukshuk/jekyll-scholar/issues/162">here</a> for an issue related to ‘cite’). Most fix suggestions deal with making sure that 1) <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">, group: :jekyll_plugins</code> is added next to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gem "jekyll-scholar"</code> line in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gemfile</code>, and 2) <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">plugins_dir: [jekyll-scholar]</code> is included in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_config.yml</code> file. However, for al-folio, these suggestions are not that helpful because these lines are already there. So what has exactly happened?</p> <p>As you probably notice already, these issues all point toward <a href="https://github.com/inukshuk/jekyll-scholar"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll-scholar</code></a>, which handles ‘bibliography’, ‘cite’, etc. As pointed out by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll-scholar</code> developer, for security reasons, GitHub Pages does not allow running arbitrary Ruby code in its build process. This means that it is not possible to use third-party Jekyll plugins at will, and only a restricted handful of selected Ruby gems can be loaded. Unfortunately, <a href="https://github.com/inukshuk/jekyll-scholar">Jekyll-scholar is not among those</a>, <strong>so it is not possible to use it and at the same time rely on the automated GitHub Pages build system</strong> (see a similar discussion <a href="https://github.com/inukshuk/jekyll-scholar/issues/163">here</a>).</p> <p>The solution to this issue is to <strong>type the script <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.bin/deploy</code> in terminal for deployment, which is THE key step of the entire deployment process</strong>. In this step, you will be asked for your GitHub username and password. However, if you directly type your GitHub password, you will encounter the following error message:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>remote: Support for password authentication was removed on August 13, 2021. Please use a personal access token instead.
fatal: Authentication failed for 'https://github.com/your-github-username/your-website-name.github.io.git/'
</code></pre></div></div> <p>As the message suggested, starting August 13, 2021, GitHub no longer accepts <em>account passwords</em> when authenticating Git operations on GitHub.com. Instead, <strong>token-based authentication (e.g., personal access, OAuth, SSH Key, or GitHub App installation token) will be required for all authenticated Git operations</strong>. To set up your personal token, you need to follow the instructions <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token">here</a>.</p> <p>Now you are almost done. You can type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.bin/deploy</code> in terminal and press enter/return. Hopefully, you will receive a “successful deployment” message. Now you try to load <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">your-website-name.github.io</code> in your favorite browser, but all you can see is a 404 error message that says “there isn’t a GitHub Pages site here”. For new users, this can be very confusing. After all, the page has been successfully deployed. The reason why you see an error is because you are currently in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">master</code> branch. <strong>For deployment, you must set the branch to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gh-pages</code> branch in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Pages</code> section under the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Settings</code> of your repository</strong>. The details on how to configure a publishing source of your GitHub Pages site are discussed <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site">here</a>. Now everything should work!</p> <p align="center"><img src="/assets/img/blogpost/2022-10-21-blog2.png" width="750"/></p> <hr/> <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2> <p>In summary, to successfully deploy your website for the first time, you would need to do it by yourself by first creating your personal authentication token, typing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.bin/deploy</code>, and changing your branch to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gh-pages</code> instead of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">master</code>. Fortunately, for later deployments, the automatic deployment feature will take effect and works great, and GitHub will automatically deploy your webiste whenever you push changes to GitHub.

Prior to this position at OSU, Prof. Jiang worked as a Process Development Engineer in the Crop Protection Process Sciences and Technology R&amp;D group at <a href="https://www.corteva.com/">Corteva Agriscience</a> (formerly Agriculture Division of DowDuPont). Prof. Jiang obtained his BChE from the <a href="https://cse.umn.edu/cems">University of Minnesota</a> in 2014 and PhD from <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/ChE">Purdue University</a> in 2018.</p> <p>At OSU, Prof. Jiang will lead the Computational Laboratory for Advanced Manufacturing and Sustainability (CLAMS), where he will develop advanced process systems engineering methods and tools to solve some of the most critical challenges of our time, including separations, pharmaceutical manufacturing, digital agriculture, sustainability, Food-Energy-Water Nexus, and so on. Prof. Jiang has a broad interest in various fields of process systems engineering, such as mathematical modeling, process optimization and control, conceptual process synthesis and design, machine learning, and data analytics.</p> <p>In the near term, Prof. Jiang is committed to combining his expertise in process systems engineering and agriculture and specialty chemicals manufacturing (in particular, agrochemical manufacturing) to address various sustainability issues related to Food-Energy-Water-Climate Nexus:</p> <blockquote> <p>“By 2050, the global population is expected to reach 9.7 billion. Thus, the global food production must increase by at least 70% by 2050. Considering that current agriculture and food sectors are already one of the largest consumers of global water, energy, and land resources, the key question that is critical to the sustainable development of human society in the 21<sup>st</sup> century is the following - <strong>How can we massively increase crop production without putting additional stress on land, energy, and water resources while at the same time ensuring sustainability for all?</strong>”</p> </blockquote> <p>To address this grand challenge, CLAMS will work closely with experts in agronomy, biology, chemistry, chemical and environmental engineering, economics and finance, artificial intelligence, data science, and operations research to reexamine and renovate all human activities involved in the R&amp;D, production, distribution, processing, and consumption of agricultural products, thereby offering data-driven, systems-oriented solutions and insights to the sustainable intensification of global agriculture and food systems.
